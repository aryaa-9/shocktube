# shocktube

This repository processes and analyzes the data from a shock tube experiment conducted during my internship at JAXA. The experiment involved designing and building a shock tube, measuring pressure variations upstream and downstream of the shock front, and calculating the speed of sound using phase differences between these signals.

Additionally, computing the Fourier transform of the pressure variation data allows for the visualization of the frequency spectrum to identify the dominant frequencies.
